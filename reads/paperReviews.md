## Brucella in Australia
[Cook et. al, 1966](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-0813.1966.tb04603.x/abstract)  
Cook, I., R. W. Campbell, and G. Barrow. 1966. Brucellosis in North Queensland rodents. Australian veterinary journal 42:5–8.  

This paper introduced the identification of *Brucella* in rodents trapped in Jordan Creek near Palmerston National Park, located in along the east coast of central Queensland, Australia. There was little domestic cattle used in the area, though wild pigs were known to inhabit the grounds. Spleen and liver tissues were extracted from trapped rodents - 6 different species in all - and used as source material to innoculate mice with; of the 54 total rodents, 30 were *Rattus assimilis* and 16 were *Meloymys cervinipes*. A total of 7 *Brucella* strains were derived from three species: *Rattus assimilis* (4), *Melomys cervinipes* (2), and *M. lutilllus* (1).  

- Serum from putatively infected mice provided serum with which agglutination tests for a variety of microorganisms were conducted, including *B. abortus*, *Coxiella burneii*, *Proteus* OX19, and several strains of *Leptospira* and *Salmonella*. Agglutination tests were *positive for *B. militensis**.  
- Further microbiological tests includded cross immunity for *Rikettsia tsutsugamushi*, tail blood smear observations for *Eperythrozoon cocoides* and *Haemobartonella muris*, and heart blood smear for *Spirillum minus*. Inflammed spleens from infected mice were used as sources to isolate potential *Brucella* pathogens. While *E. coccoides* was identified in two of these mice, eight total isolations were identified. Seven of eight of these isolates grew on Albimi agar plates, in both 10% CO<sub>2</sub> and air (both at 37 °C). Oxidative metabolic tests indicated utilization of all eight amino acids and three carbohydrate sources tested, indicating that they are **most likely classified as *B. suis* type 3** strains.  
- Guinea pigs were infected with four of the isolates; all died between 12-28 days. Serum agglutinated to *B. abortus* antigen.

This paper proved significant because it speculated that rodents may serve as a natural reservoir with which domestic livestock may become infected. Pigs were known to eat rodents; the question is whether or not this consumption would prove to transmit one *Brucella* strain from one host to a different (presumably mammalian) host. What was unclear was whether the rodents were reservoirs of the pathogen, or if they became infected by the pigs initially. A few other natural history notes: 
- *B. suis* is transmitted in pigs when swine suffer abortions
- *B. suis* is also transmitted frequently through urine, making it likely that a herd is heavily contaminated in domestic conditions

## Brucella in Rodents
[Meyer, 1976](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0093691X76900194)  
Meyer, M. E. 1976. Evolution and taxonomy in the genus Brucella : Brucellosis of rodents. Theriogenology 6:263–272.  
This was a follow up to Cook et al., 1966, which had left unclear whether Brucella observed in rodents served as the reservoir species with which domesticated animals acquired the pathogen, or if pigs, cows, etc. were tranmitting the pathogen to the rodents. The scientist examined 19 extant strains from North America, Africa, and Australia isolated over the past 20 years. Additional data from USSR was incorporated into the analsyis from prior reports.  
*Brucella* were compared using classic (deterministic) microbiological tests as well as oxidative metabolic patterns of 39 amino acids and carbohydrates. Observations are summarized as follows:
- Metabolic patterns suggested strains from rodents from Africa and Austraila **are similar to *B. susis* ** because that strain is the only one in the genus which can oxidize substances of the urea cycle. *B. susis* strains reported from the USSR also demonstrated such metabolic activity. However, the *B. neotomae* strains do not metabolize these amino acids. **This suggests that all rodent-obtained *Brucella* with the exception of *B. neotomae* are similar to *B. suis* **.
- Determinative methods similarly suggested that **all *Brucella* obtained from rodents are similar to *B. susis* WITH THE EXCEPTION of *B. neotomae* **. This distinction among isolates had to do with a pair of tests, though I didn't find these as conclusive as the binary metabolic results noted above:
  - the concentration of phage which a strain woudd lyse
  - the agglutinability in monospecific antisera
  - hydrogen sulfide production  
** Each of these patterns can vary among *B. suis* strains, which makes me think that a genomic approach may reveal different patterns of shared ancestry**.
